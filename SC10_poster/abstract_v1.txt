In molecular simulations, it is often the case that the dynamics of interest are dominated by rare events, where the waiting time for an event to occur is much longer than the duration of the event itself.  For these cases, it is useful to separate phase space into discrete regions, sample the regions in parallel, and then collate the regional statistics to determine general properties of the system such as reaction rates and transition states.  Nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS) provides a prescription for this process when the system under study is driven far from equilibrium.

The intrinsically parallel nature of the NEUS algorithm makes it ideal for studying large chemical systems with supercomputing.  Here, processes only need to communicate at the beginning and the end of each trajectory segment.  As a consequence, as the size or complexity of the system increases, communication events get farther apart, and the system becomes more easily parallelizable.  We use the Global Arrays toolkit to set up a common memory space that is accessible to all of the processes, which, in our case, simplifies the parallelization process considerably compared to straightforward MPI.

In this poster we describe the first application of NEUS to a parallel computing architecture: the BlueGene/P.  We use this tool to examine the dynamics of a coarse-grained, 262-residue RNA segment under explicit flow modeled with stochastic rotation dynamics.  Strong scaling up to ~4000 processors shows little losses in efficiency, and we expect that this algorithm can eventually scale even higher.  Preliminary results show that the flow-extended RNA molecule can visit different meta-stable states, whose relative probabilities depend strongly on the pressure that drives the flow of the solvent.  These developments suggest that the parallel version of NEUS will be a powerful tool to examine rare events in large nonequilibrium systems.
